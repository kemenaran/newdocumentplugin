NewDocumentPlugIn adds a "New document" contextual menu to the Finder.
You can thus create easily new documents without opening the associated
application.

It works with Mac OS 10.4 to 10.5 (**does not work on Snow Leopard yet**).

When creating a new document, the document name is highlighted, in order
to customize the name without superfluous keystroke (ensure that GUI Scripting
is enabled for this).

You can easily add your own templates : just drop an empty file of the wanted
type in the "Templates" folder of the plugin.

The plugin is localized in English and French. You can add localizations for
the contextual menu labels and for the document names if wanted.

NewDocumentPlugIn uses CoreFoundation and AppleScript.
